## My process

I started by analyzing the provided design and breaking it into sections. The main structure consists of a container with a NFT preview card image and a text description.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned how to hover effect an image.

```html
 <div class="container">
    <img class="default-img" src="images/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="default-img">
    
    <div class="hover-img">
    <img src="images/icon-view.svg" alt="hover-img">
    </div>
```
```css
.container{
    height: 500px;
    width: 300px;
    background-color: hsl(216, 50%, 16%);
    border-radius: 15px;
    padding: 20px;
    position: relative;
}

.container .default-img{
    width: 100%;
    border-radius: 15px;
}

.container .hover-img{
    position: absolute;
    top: 20px;
    left: 20px;
    width: 260px;
    height: 260px;
    background-color: hsla(178, 100%, 50%, 0.377); 
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;    
    border-radius: 15px;
    opacity: 0;
}

.container .hover-img:hover {
    opacity: 1;
    cursor: pointer;
}

.hover-img img{
    width: 40px;
    height: 40px;
}
```

### Continued development

- In future projects i want to learn more about CSS grid and flexbox method.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) - This helped me for Centering in CSS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flexbox) - This is an amazing free resource which helped me finally understand Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
